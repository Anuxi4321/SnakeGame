# SnakeGame
This SnakeGame is from a FreeCodeCamp tutorial video, I just made a few tweaks on the code. 

Tweaks that I made to the code:

1. Made the grid 30x30 instead of 20x20
2. Added Starting Speed Options on the game (Easy, Medium, Hard).
3. Added a background Music.
4. Changed the color pallete. From Green to Blue, cause I like blue
5. Added a background image.
6. Added a toggle for the music, you can mute the music.
